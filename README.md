### Hi there

I'm a Linux Enthusiast, so I write a lot of scripts or codes for personal linux tools, and I write some for emacs.

My research area is Hydrology/Hydraulics. I'd be happy to collaborate on things related to those.

My hobbies include anime and light novels, so I sometimes contribute to fan translations by making scripts or proof reading. Or very rarely trying to translate using meager japanese that I know (and lots of jisho/deepl).

You can reach me in discord, my username is: thevoidzero#４６８６ (type it out, don't copy it)

My latest project: [LiTeX mode](https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/litex-mode) for emacs.
